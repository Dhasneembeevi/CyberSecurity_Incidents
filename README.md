# Cybersecurity Incidents Classification
This project is designed to classify cybersecurity incidents into various categories based on specific features of each incident. The model helps in automating the classification process, enabling quick analysis and response to security threats. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project can aid cybersecurity teams in identifying and prioritizing security incidents efficiently.

# Project Overview
Cybersecurity incidents are becoming increasingly frequent and complex. Effective incident classification is critical for prioritizing response efforts and minimizing impact. This project addresses the need for automated classification of cybersecurity incidents by developing a machine learning model trained on historical data.

The project includes:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering for enhanced model performance
Training a classification model to categorize incidents accurately
Evaluation of model accuracy using metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score

Features
Data Processing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical data to prepare the dataset for training.
Classification Model: Uses a classification algorithm (e.g., RandomForest, Logistic Regression, etc.) to predict the category of each incident.
Model Evaluation: Provides a detailed classification report and confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes features like incident type, source IP, target IP, incident timestamp, severity, and others. Each entry is labeled according to its incident type, which serves as the target variable for classification.

Model Training
The training process includes:
Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets (default is 80% for training and 20% for testing).
Training a classification model using the selected algorithm.
Evaluating the model on the test data and generating metrics.

Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:
Confusion Matrix: Shows the counts of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Indicates the accuracy of predictions for each class.
Accuracy: Overall accuracy across all classes.
